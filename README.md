# LiveSeeding-Training-T4.2

This is the homework for the LiveSeeding workshop to complete.

The script is filled out to 90%, but three slots (marked by "....") needs to be filled to make the code functional. Please refer to the document https://github.com/mischn-dev/LiveSeeding-Training-T4.2/blob/main/Genomic_Prediction_workshop_liveseeding.html for advice on how to solve the assignment.

To complete the assignment, you have three options:

    send the filled out script
    Send the correlation scores you obtained for the rrBLUP and GBLUP models
    Answer in a text form that describes the process you need to perform to obtain the results


All files necessary to complete the assignment can befound on this page and are free to be downloaded:
