# LiveSeeding-Training-T4.2

This is the homework for the LiveSeeding workshop to complete.

The script is filled out to 90%, but three slots (marked by "....") needs to be filled to make the code functional. 
Please refer to the document 
https://github.com/mischn-dev/LiveSeeding-Training-T4.2/blob/main/Genomic_Prediction_workshop_liveseeding.html
for advice on how to solve the assignment.

To complete the assignment, you have three options:

1. send the filled out script 
2. Send the correlation scores you obtained for the rrBLUP and GBLUP models 
3. Answer in a text form that describes the process you need to perform to obtain the results

Hint - if you are totally new to programming, feel free to get some support from chatGPT, DeepSeek or other LLMs
